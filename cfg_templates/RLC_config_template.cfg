===================================================
Parameter Description
===================================================
viewNum: Number of views at one direction. For example: viewNum = 5 means 5x5 views in 2D configuration
         Currently, we recommend you to set this value to 5 or 7 to ensure good rendering quality from Lenslet video to Multi-view Video.
         viewNum = 5 (default value) 5x5 views in 2D configuration
         viewNum = 7                 7x7 views in 2D configuration

rmode:  Resolution mode, and this value must be a integer. 
        It is corresponded to the "skipped_number_of_pixel_around_ML" in the "MultiViewImage.cpp".
        (for Raytrix R5)
        Resolution mode = 1: 912x880 (default value)
        Resolution mode = 2: 832x792
        Resolution mode = 3: 744x712
        Resolution mode = 4: 656x624
        Resolution mode = 5: 568x544
        Resolution mode = 6: 480x456

pmode: patch size estimation mode. Please refer to our paper [1][2] for more details.
       patchEstimationMode, 
       LAPLACIAN_BASE_ALL = 0, (default value) calculating Laplacian sum using all views,
       LAPLACIAN_BASE_CENTER = 1, calculating Laplacian sum using center view only.

       "There are two patch size estimation method using depth information"
       DEPTH_BASE_V1 = 2, 
       DEPTH_BASE_V2 = 3,     
       Please refer following paper for the details,
       Ref: T. Georgiev and A. Lumsdaine, "Reducing Plenoptic Camera Artifacts", Computer Graphics forum, 2010.

mmode: merge mode for different lens type. Please refer to our paper for more details.
       mergeMode AVERAGE = 0, merge different lens type using arithmetic mean,
       GAUSSIAN = 1, merge different lens type using Gaussian weights,
       BLEND = 2, (default value), merge different lens type using arithmetic mean and Gaussian weights both.

lmode: lens Alignment mode: 
       NMF = 0, (N = LensType_1.png, M = LensType_2.png and F = LensType_3.png)
       FMN = 1, (F = LensType_1.png, M = LensType_2.png and N = LensType_3.png) (default)
       NFM = 2, (N = LensType_1.png, F = LensType_2.png and M = LensType_3.png)
       FNM = 3  (F = LensType_1.png, N = LensType_2.png and M = LensType_3.png)
       MFN = 4, (M = LensType_1.png, F = LensType_2.png and N = LensType_3.png) (new) 
       MNF = 5, (M = LensType_1.png, N = LensType_2.png and F = LensType_3.png) (new)

	   
       This sets the alignment order of three micro-lens type. 
       NMF means {(N)ear, (M)iddle, (F)ar} focal distances for {LensType_1.png, LensType_2.png and LensType_3.png}, respectively.
       For example: NMF represents that the generated lenstype should be arranged with Near focal distance, Middle focal distance, Far distance.

       We recommend you to do a test with single frame input data firstly, while you set the parameters to default value. 
       If you find that the generated three lens-type images  (LensType_1.png, LensType_2.png and LensType_3.png) 
       are not arranged with default mode (lmode: FMN), please switch it to the suitable one.
       By single frame conversion, you may set the other parameters too.	   

===========Path Setting===============================================
Calibration_xml: The directory of camera calibration file and the file name.

RawImage_Path: The directory of  lenslet raw images and their file name format.

Output_Path: The directory for output multi-view video

===========Pre-processing===============================================
Debayer_mode: Demosaicing method applied to input raw image.
              0 means without Demosaicing processing (default)
              1 means BG to RGB; 2 means GB to RGB; 3 means RG to RGB; 4 mean GR to RGB.
              Please refer following link for more details about OpenCV demosaicing precessing.
              https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/de/d25/imgproc_color_conversions.html

Isfiltering: Applying a Guassain filter on raw images before patch size estimation.
             0 means turn off (default), 1 means turn on.
             Please refer following link for more details about CLAHE:
             https://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html

============Post-processing===============================================
isCLAHE: Applying CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) on rendering multi-view images.
         0 means turn off (default), 1 means turn on.

Gamma: This is to adjust parameter of Gamma correction. 
       A positive floating point number is needed, we set this parameter to 1.0 (default).
       Please refer following link for more details about Gammar correction:
       https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/dc1/tutorial_basic_linear_transform.html

============Temporal Consistency===============================================
Lambda: This value should be a positive floating point number.
        It is the coeffient of penalty of temporal consitency.
        0 means without penalty of temporal consitency.
        We recommend setting this parameter to 0.05. (default)

Sigma:  This value should be a floating point number.
        It is the sigma of Gaussian funtion of temporal consitency.
        0 means without Gaussian filter for temporal consitency. (default)
        If you want to activate this function, we recommend setting this parameter to 0.667.

============Others===============================================
input_model: 0 or 1; 0 means RGB model, 1 means YUV420 model

output_model: 0 or 1; 0 means RGB model, 1 means YUV420 model

start_frame: To set the start frame number of input data. 

end_frame: To set the end frame number of input data.
